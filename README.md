# One Key
This game was made during the **GMTK Game Jam 2019** where the theme was **"Only One"**.

One Key is a puzzle platformer where the goal is to advance to the next room by using the key. There is however, only one key, and multiple doors. The key can only be used once and it's up to the player to figure out the best way to use it.
